Rasterpy contains basic routines to read and write raster files with python. With Rasterpy one can read the following raster formats:

* **'tif'**: All `.tiff` formats like GEOtiff etc.
* **'.hdr'**: All ENVI formats like `.bin` and `.hdr` formats. This is usefull if you want to read data from third-party software like Polsarpro.
